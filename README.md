# Implementation-of-Gradient-Boosting-Algorithm
This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of the **Gradient Boosting algorithm** for both classification and regression tasks using scikit-learn. It applies the model on two popular datasets: **Iris** (for classification) and **California Housing** (for regression).
